<p>Millions of years in the future, the sun is dying and a slowly freezing Urth is seeing its final days. Over the millennia, humanity has reached the heights of a space-faring civilization, and then declined to an almost medieval level. Ruins of unfathomable technology are strewn across Urth, and the wildlife is a mix of alien organisms and genetically-modified Urth creatures. Most of the remnants of humanity live in and around the ancient, country-sized city-state of Nessus, which is ruled by the Autarch, the Self Ruler. The people of Urth await the arrival of the New Sun, a messianic figure from the past who will reappear to renew the sun.</p>

<p><cite>The Shadow of the Torturer</cite>, along with the rest of the books in the <cite>Book of the New Sun</cite> series (<cite>The Claw of the Conciliator</cite> (1981), <cite>The Sword of the Lichtor</cite> (1982), <cite>The Citadel of the Autarch</cite> (1983), and <cite>The Urth of the New Sun</cite> (1987)) are written as the personal diary of Severian, who begins his life as an apprentice in the guild of torturers. Early in <cite>The Shadow of the Torturer</cite>, Severian becomes exiled from his guild, and begins a long and bizarre journey through Nessus and the surrounding regions. He meets many strange people and otherworldly beings, and he becomes involved in things of global / cosmic importance.</p>

<p>Despite Severian being a journeyman in the guild of torturers, these books contain little violence. (George R. R. Martin's <cite>A Song of Ice and Fire</cite> series is much more violent, for example.) Severian is generally a nice guy, and he didn’t choose to be a torturer; he was adopted by the guild as a baby. There is much love between Severian and the masters of the guild that raised him. Severian is fed, clothed, kindly cared for, and given an education. Yet, they are all torturers and executioners by trade. It presents an interesting dilemma for the reader, to say the least.</p>

<p>These books are not easy to understand. As they are Severian’s personal diaries, they contain little exposition. Why should Severian explain a culture and a world in which he is already familiar? Important revelations can be given in easy-to-miss, offhand comments. Severian contradicts himself, misunderstands situations, obscures his motives, or is unaware of his motives. He’s an unreliable narrator, like any real person would be. Sections of time are missing, leaving you to guess what happened. The plot is bizarre and surreal, and it makes heavy use of allegories (Allegories for what? I’m not always sure...) And since these diaries have been translated from a future language which does not yet exist, the language that the author uses is full of obscure “best fit” words taken from archaic Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and so forth.</p>

</p>But for me, all the things that made these difficult books also made them great books. They’re fun to read; they’re fun to puzzle out and think about and piece together. I’ve read them all at least twice. They are so complex, layered, and rich, that you can get something new from them every time. In total, the five books in this series have won a Nebula Award, a Locus Award, a World Fantasy Award, and a British Science Fiction Association Award. And they have been nominated for four Nebula Awards, and two Hugo awards, among others. This series is the masterpiece of science fiction and fantasy that you’ve probably never heard of.</p>
