<p><cite>Clans of the Alphane Moon</cite> is my favorite Philip K. Dick book. Like most of his books, it’s bizarre and hallucinatory.</p>

<p>In the future, there is war between Earth and giant furry white beetles from Alpha Centauri. Earth abandons its only colony in the Alphane system, a small moon that houses a psychiatric hospital. Over the years, the psychiatric patients escape the hospital and populate the planet, forming different clans/cities based on their mental illnesses. For example, the paranoids live in Adolfville, running surveillance and defense projects, and the schizophrenics are poets and shamans and live in the town of Joan d'Arc.</p>

<p>On Earth, Chuck and his wife Mary get divorced, and Chuck moves out. Chuck’s new neighbor is Lord Running Clam, a psychic slime mold from Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede. Lord Running Clam likes to listen to his Chuck's thoughts, slime his way under the door, and make helpful comments.</p>

<p>Chuck, Mary, and Lord Running Clam all end up on the Alphane moon, and then the real adventures begin...</p>
