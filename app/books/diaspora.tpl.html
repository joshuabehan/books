<p>About a thousand years into the future, humanity has become extremely diverse: some are baseline humans, some have genetically modified themselves into unrecognizable creatures, some have uploaded themselves into robot bodies, and some have abandoned the physical realm entirely and uploaded themselves into a simulated reality. <cite>Diaspora</cite> deals mainly with the latter: the uploaded humans and their descendants, known collectively as Citizens.</p>

<p>These digital Citizens live in virtual societies called Polises, with each Polis having it’s own culture, identity, ways of reproducing, etc. Most Polis societies are genderless, and the author makes use of the genderless pronouns “ve”, “vis”, and “ver”. The Citizens and Polises have control over nearly every aspect of their reality: the rate at which they experience time, their appearance to others, the environments in which they live. The Polises have sensors, drones, and satellites throughout the solar system, which connect them to the physical world. Citizens often spend their time doing abstract mathematical things, like conducting research by mining in the Truth Mines, or learning how to turn a sphere into a torus in 5-dimensional space (or something like that).</p>

<p>The beginning of <cite>Diaspora</cite> deals mainly with getting to know the Polises and the Citizens, and watching the main character Yatima become sentient, grow up, and make friends with other Citizens. The other Citizens help to educate Yatima, which involves of a lot of mathematical lessons that I don’t understand. Eventually, something happens that causes a Diaspora, and the rest of the novel follows the Diaspora and documents what happens.</p>

<p>This book is very hard sci-fi, and contains a huge amount of physics and math that is beyond my understanding. However, the science that I was able to grasp was very interesting - for example, did you know that, in 5-dimensional space, stars would have no satellites? Because of... <a href="http://www.gregegan.net/DIASPORA/15/15.html" target="_blank">something about gravity?</a> The more you know!<p>

<p>The whole book is interesting, from start to finish. The future that Greg Egan presents is incredibly interesting and inventive. The science is fascinating (what little I could understand), and I really enjoyed the characters. If you enjoy reading about science, physics, and transhumanism / posthumanism, then read this book. It’s great.<p>
