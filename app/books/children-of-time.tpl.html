<p>In the near future, humanity experiments with terraforming and evolutionary uplift projects around other stars. Fast forward to much much later, and humanity, having ruined Earth, needs a new home. All the humans pile into a single ark ship, Battlestar Galactica style, and begin a journey toward the forgotten terraformed planets; a journey which will take thousands of years. Meanwhile, intelligent life has begun to evolve on one of the aforementioned planets. What will happen when humanity arrives?</p>

<p>The story spans thousands of years, and touches on themes of evolution, sexism, religion, technology, violence and non-violence, and the nature of humanity. We witness the biological, cultural, and technological evolution of a not-so-alien species familiar to us all. I canâ€™t say much more without ruining the surprises found in this wonderful book. The story and the characters touched my heart and brought tears to my eyes. <cite>Children of Time</cite> won the Arthur C. Clarke Award, and it should have won many more. Definitely read it.</p>
