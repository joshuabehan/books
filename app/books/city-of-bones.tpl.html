<p><cite>City of Bones</cite> is set on a post-apocalyptic desert world (no relation to Earth), mostly covered by a great, deadly Waste. Most of the story happens in Charisat, a city-state with a strict social hierarchy based on access to water. Mages protect the Elector, the ruler of Charisat, by using bits of knowledge gleaned from the relics of the Ancients - but sometimes the Mages accidentally go insane. Also, ghosts can be deadly, so watch out for those. The main character is different from the humans of the cities, as he's from a race of marsupial desert-adapted humans who live in the Waste. He's been hired to find some Ancient relics, and he gets involved in all sorts dangerous magical mix-ups and intrigues along the way.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this book. It's full of anthropology, archaeology, mystery, magic, and a handsome marsupial man. It's like no other book I have read before. If you like fantasy but you're tired of all the Tolkien elves, dragons, princesses, and wizards, then try reading this.</p>
