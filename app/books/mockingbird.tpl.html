<p><cite>Mockingbird</cite> is set in a dystopian future where a drugged and stupid humanity is slowly going extinct. Humans have automated every aspect of their lives and then retreated into a narcotic bliss. No man or woman alive knows how to read, and neither do they know how to repair the aging technology that sustains mankind. Society is centered around pleasure, individualism,  and privacy. It is a crime to speak to another person or even look them in the eye. Everyone spends their days in a drugged-out haze, thanks to the free drugs provided by ever present vending machines. Despite heavy doses of pharmaceuticals, humanity seems to be losing the will to live, and suicides are not uncommon.</p>

<p>The story revolves around three main characters: Spofforth, a suicidal android who can’t disobey his programming; Paul Bentley, a man who teaches himself how to read; and Mary Lou, a free spirit who stopped taking the tranquilizers and narcotics that all other humans take.</p>

<p>The novel is infused with a poignant sadness, and then, when Paul and Mary Lou meet up (the last two thinking humans alive) the sadness is intermixed with hope and love. It’s a beautiful story that will make you cry. How many dystopian science fiction novels can be described as beautiful and hopeful? It’s truly one of a kind.</p>
