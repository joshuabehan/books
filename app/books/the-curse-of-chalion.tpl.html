<p><cite>The Curse of Chalion</cite> tells the story of Cazaril, a respectable, yet broken, ex-warrior, who gets hired to tutor and protect a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpiritedYoungLady" target="_blank">spirited young princess</a>. Then things get complicated. Obviously a curse is involved.</p>

<p><cite>Paladin of Souls</cite> (2003) is a direct sequel to <cite>The Curse of Chalion.</cite> The main character is the princess's 40 year old widow mother, who most people think is depressed and crazy. She's not crazy though; she's just had a hard life and she's sarcastic and bored, and she leaves and has a supernatural adventure.</p>

<p>What makes these books interesting is their focus on the theological and the supernatural. In the kingdom of Chalion, there exists five gods: the Mother of Summer, the Father of Winter, the Daughter of Spring, the Son of Autumn, and the Bastard. These gods aren't just abstractions based on the seasons - they have distinct personalities and they involve themselves in the lives of the characters. For me, the Bastard is the most interesting god - being the god of balance, demons, disasters, things out of season, and gay people. He's not a villainous god; he's the most accepting and welcoming of them all.</p>

<p>When someone asks me to recommend a fantasy book to them, I usually suggest this book and its sequel. The Chalion books are both accessible and extremely interesting. <cite>The Curse of Chalion</cite> won a Mythopoeic Fantasy Award, and was nominated for a Hugo Award, and itâ€™s sequel, <cite>Paladin of Souls</cite>, won a Hugo Award, a Nebula Award, and a Locus Award. They are great books.</p>
