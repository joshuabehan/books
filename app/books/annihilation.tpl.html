<p class="desc-text__blockquote">Where lies the strangling fruit that came from the hand of the sinner I shall bring forth the seeds of the dead to share with the worms that gather in the darkness and surround the world with the power of their lives while from the dim lit halls of other places forms that never were and never could be writhe for the impatience of the few who never saw what could have been...</p>

<p>Area X is a haunting, pristine wilderness on the abandoned coast, created by unknown forces for unknown reasons. It has the power to contaminate and infect those inside it. Most humans who enter Area X rarely return; they are killed by the wildlife, they die of mysterious illnesses, they commit suicide or murder, or they are transformed into something less than (more than?) human.</p>

<p>Sent by the government, a team of four women (a biologist, an anthropologist, a surveyor, and a psychologist) make an expedition into Area X to map the terrain and collect specimens. Let’s just say that things do not go according to plan.</p>

<p><cite>Annihilation</cite>, and it’s sequels <cite>Authority</cite> (2014) and <cite>Acceptance</cite> (2014), together called the <cite>Southern Reach Trilogy</cite>, are an amazing blend of weird sci-fi and horror that left me speechless. The wild beauty of Area X is stunning, and I felt like the unexplainable things that happened in Area X connected with me on a unconscious level. As I was reading, I wasn’t always sure I understood what was happening in the story, but I felt like my dreaming mind understood perfectly.</p>

<p>Not everyone will enjoy this series. It deals with the unknowable, and everything is not always explained. The narrators are unreliable. Endings are open. You won’t find a lot of exposition or answers, and often you will think “what is going on??” But that’s what makes this series so fun. <cite>Annihilation</cite> won both the Nebula Award and the Shirley Jackson Award in 2014. It's some of the best weird fiction I have ever read.</p>
