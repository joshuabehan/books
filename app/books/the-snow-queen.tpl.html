<p><cite>The Snow Queen</cite> is a science fiction adaptation of a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale by the same name. A lot of it takes place on a planet called Tiamat, a cold ocean planet sparsely inhabited by humans who worship the ocean and eat a lot of fish. They are divided into two societies - the more traditional Summers who rule with their Summer Queen during the 150 year summer, and the technological Winters who rule with their Snow Queen during the 150 year winter. Matriarchy!</p>

<p>Also present on Tiamat are an interstellar Hegemony, who exploit the planet's natural resources to gain immortality for the rich, and who work to keep Tiamatian people technologically primitive, dependent, planet-bound, and exploitable.</p>

<p>The main character is a Summer named Moon. She has a lot of adventures, falls in love, gets involved with ancient technology so advanced that it almost seems magical, and has a great time being a heroine.</p>

<p><cite>The Snow Queen</cite> won a Hugo Award, and was also nominated for a Nebula Award. I really enjoyed this book and its sequels: <cite>World's End</cite> (1984) and <cite>The Summer Queen</cite> (1991). <cite>The Snow Queen Cycle</cite> series explores some interesting themes: struggle over access to resources, exploitation by the rich, colonialism, environmentalism, feminism, technology as magic, religion vs science, just to name a few. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a little social commentary with their sci-fi.</p>
